#**Given pairwise point coordinates on the x-axis, determine if line segments defined by a pair of points intersect and return the segments defined by joining those points** 

e.g if inputs are (x1, x2), (x3, x4), (x5, x6) and (x1, x2) and (x3, x4) intersect such that x3< x2 and x4 > x2, the new segment simply becomes (x1, x4)
