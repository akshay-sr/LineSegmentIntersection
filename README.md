# Given pairwise point coordinates on the x-axis, determine if line segments defined by a pair of points intersect.

* Expected output: Return the overlapption line segments defined by encompassing the overlap 

Example:

    Let inputs be defined by (x1, x2), (x3, x4), (x5, x6).
    Suppose (x1, x2) and (x3, x4) intersect such that x3< x2 and x4 > x2.
    
    Result: The overlapping segments are defined by (x1, x4)
